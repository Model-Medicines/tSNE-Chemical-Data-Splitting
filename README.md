# t-SNE Chemical Data Splitting

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of splitting chemical data using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for enhanced model benchmarking, visualization, and analysis in the context of molecular property prediction.

## Overview

The `t-SNE Chemical Split - bioRxiv.ipynb` notebook is designed to help researchers and data scientists better understand the separation of chemical similarity between training data and testing data for model benchmarking.
